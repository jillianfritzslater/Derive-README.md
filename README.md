## Site 1
-http://www.architectsofficial.com/?fbclid=IwAR2p2Z2bTPrp2qe0G8-4MNwYQA_W43BkHxEN34PD91BhpCfMNCriRKJn4hA

-While keeping tabs on a band I follow, I was checking their Facebook page and clicked a link that directed me to their Official Site.
<br>
-The Website is designed in black & gray tones, eliminating the issues some users may stuggle with such as being colourblind. The hierarchy in the website is well laid out. The Typography is also large and easily legible. I'd say this is a 'trendy' design because of how legible and straight to the point it is. Simple is in.
<br>
-The navigation is easy, all you need to do in order to see more information is scroll up/down.
<br>
The music video is interactive, along with along with all of the menu tabs, tour dates, and websites that feature their merchandise.
<br>
-The site is useful because it can direct users to their music, merchandise or tour dates depending on what the user is interested in; in my case, I used the website to look at their tour dates, which then directed me to where I could purchase a ticket.
<br>
-The one thing I would change about this website would be the size of the video at the top of the page, it seemed unecessary and gave me more to scroll past when looking for my desired information.

## Site 2
-https://www.spotify.com/ca-en/
<br>
-I wanted to listen to music so I opened up Spotify
<br>
-The website design very current and trendy, it's a bright and welcoming site that has a clean and easily understood look.
<br>
-The navigation is very common; with the sign in/sign up options on the right of the bar on he top, and the company options such as 'help', 'about' and 'jobs' at the bottom.
<br>
Most of the Typography is interactive, along with the social media icons at the very bottom, allowing the user to know exactly what their options are within the website.
<br>
The one thing I would change about this website is possibly adding a 'featured' section on the front page to show those who aren't members an idea of what artist's are a part of Spotify Music.

## Site 3
-https://moonglow.ca/
<br>
-While scrolling through Instagram, an ad for this website popped up in my Newsfeed. I like jewellery and I'm fascinated with anything to do with the moon, so I clicked the link and was directed to their website.
<br>
-The website design is current, very clean and proportionate based off of the Typography and overall navigation, colour palettes and placement. 
<br>
-It's a static design that only becomes interactive when the user moves the mouse on certain things; photos, menus, etc...
<br>
-The website is interactive because of the drop menus and images, you can click on the featured images and shop current collections.
<br>
-The one thing I would change about this design is the 'hand-written' Typography because it may not be legible to everyone.

## Site 4
https://www.trickortreatstudios.com/
<br>
My boyfriend recommended this website.
<br>
The design isn't trendy or current, its has a very forced vintage feel with the vignette/gradients, and the texture on the background isnt pleasing. The overall layout is also very tacky, as if they just organized everything with a grid when it should have had a more creative touch.
<br>
Based on how the website was designed to be, the navigation of it is okay - very basic. The masks shown can be clicked on for farther informtation and there are also drop down menus on the top bar.
<br>
The one thing I would change about this design is the fact that it isn't responsive to different webpage sizes.

## Site 5
https://github.com/
<br>
Some random professor suggested we work here
<br>
I personally find the look of this website outdated, there's not enough content to want to bring new users in.
<br>
The navigation is okay, it works but seems very plain. It has the standard template style top bar with the drop menus.
<br> 
This is very interactive and has a large variety of things for the user to do, it's a creative platform and the users are able to follow others, create successful codes and explore. It allows the user to create their own account and personalize it.
<br>
The one thing I would change about Github is the colour scheme, it needs to be more inviting to new users - giving them colour and potential inspiration for their web designs.
